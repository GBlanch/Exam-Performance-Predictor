### Locally testing

First, I developed my web app locally using a Conda environment to manage dependencies, libraries and packages and so ensure consistency without affecting other projects on my local machine.

Within this Conda environment, I built and tested my web app, ensuring it met my requirements and performed as expected.

Once the main functionalities of the prediction app were satisfied with the local version, I proceeded to deploy it to a production environment using AWS CodePipeline.
